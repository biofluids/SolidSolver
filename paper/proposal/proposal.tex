\section{BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION - 2 pages}

\subsection{Growth of Cells and Tissues - 0.5 page}
In the mechanical view, the most distinguishable feature of living matters is their ability to respond to environmental changes while common engineering materials cannot. Hard tissues increase their density and grow strong. One common example is that tennis players have a significantly dominant arm. While training increases the strength of bones, it is also the cause of chronic pain that many athletes suffer \cite{Kuhl6}. Soft tissues increase their volume and grow large. For instance, myocardial infarction could cause the infarcted ventricle to dilate in response to volume overload, attempting to maintain normal cardiac output. Meanwhile the pumping efficiency may be reduced, resulting in the medical condition called cardiac dilation \cite{Guccione}. Growth plays a key role in many biological and medical processes including the cardiovascular disease, tumor growth, restenosis, trauma healing, twisted bone growth and so on. The research in life science has revealed a lot of fundamental phenomenon, which greatly enrich our understanding to living matters yet are still far from being applied. Clinical researchers, on the other hand, adopt an observational and experimental strategy to explore treatments. However, the progress is relatively slow because of the lack of understanding of underlying physics. Microscopically, growth is the result of the reproduction and rearrangement of microstructures; Macroscopically, growth is the adaption of materials to the mechanical loading governed by certain laws. Therefore, people gradually come to realize that the growth of cells and tissues could not be understood with a single discipline alone. Instead, it requires the inputs from biology, mechanics, and mathematics communities.

\subsection{Review of Mathematical and Mechanical Growth Models - 1 page}
The contribution from the mechanics community to the understanding of the growth of living biological materials dates back to a hundred years ago. Thompson \cite{Thompson} and Huxley \cite{Huxley} brought up the idea of organism-level morphological view where growth is characterized as a change in form. In the recent half century, a lot of breakthroughs have been made from the research on the mechanical impact on the biological materials. Early works include the growth velocity field representation (GVFR), which includes the use of path lines and streamlines \cite{Truesdell}. Applications of the GVFR have been reported in \cite{Erickson, Erickson2, Richards}. Despite of the simplicity, GVFR is criticized of lacking most of essential ingredients that constitute a theory of material behavior \cite{Cowin}.

Another approach is the multi-constituent open systems based on the theory of mixtures \cite{Bowen, Rajagopal}. This approach models solids and fluids as combinations of diverse constituents. It is useful for modeling evolving contributions of the different solid constituents that comprise a tissue or cell and influence its growth. The resulting equations are usually complicated. For instance Humphrey and Rajagopal \cite{Humphrey} suggested that full mixture equations for mass balance (including reaction-diffusion effects of vasoactive, mitogenic, synthetic, proteolytic and inflammatory molecules) be used in combination with classical equations for linear momentum balance written in terms of rule-of-mixture relations for the stress response.

Different from the mathematical biologists cited above, modern continuum mechanical community treats the growth as a change in mass without ignoring the related change in form \cite{Ambrosi}. The key problem is how to translate the change of mass into non-uniform changes in form. Progress was made in hard tissues first because they are easier than soft tissues for three reasons, as put by Menzel and Kuhl in \cite{Menzel}: first, since they do not undergo large deformations in vivo, a linear kinematic characterization is sufficiently accurate; second, although they are multiphase materials consisting of solid and fluid constituents, for most technical applications, a single phase characterization in terms of the solid constituent alone represents their behavior sufficiently well; third, since they are relatively easy to preserve, and their ex vivo response closely matches their in vivo behavior, which make them relatively easy to test. For instance, Cowin's work in \cite{Cowin} shows that in case of small deformation and rotation, the problem that the mapping between the reference configuration and the spatial configuration is not ``onto'' can be avoided because the two configurations can be considered as identical. A lot of insights are gained from the studies on the growth of hard tissues including the mechanism of how astronauts lose bones in space \cite{Kuhl2}, the reason why hip replacement and repair induce a local loss of bone density \cite{Ambrosi}, the relationship between osteoporosis and the local bone loss \cite{Pang} and so on.

The growth of soft tissues is much more difficult for the exactly the opposite reasons: they typically undergo large deformations and their accurate characterization requires a finite kinematic approach \cite{Rodriguez}; their multi-phase character often plays a critical role, and reduction to single-phase materials could sometimes be overly simplified \cite{Mow}; and their ex vivo response might vary significantly from their in vivo behavior \cite{Krishnamurthy}. Despite of the difficulties, researchers have developed a successful strategy to characterize soft biological tissues. The key ideas of this strategy is the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. By decomposing the deformation gradient into an elastic part and a growth part, this approach identifies an intermediate configuration which does not have to be compatible \cite{Goriely, Menzel2, Rodriguez}. This kinematic approach resembles the finite strain plasticity, which decomposes the deformation into an elastic part and a plastic part. The change of form is governed by the coupled solution of balances of mass and linear momentum. Many successful applications are reported soon after the forerunners in \cite{Hsu, Skalak}. This method has been utilized to model isotropic volumetric growth of the arterial wall in response to balloon angioplasty and restenosis \cite{Himpel, Kuhl3}, to characterize growth of tendon \cite{Garikipati2}, tumors \cite{Ambrosi2}, vascular tissue \cite{Humphrey2, Humphrey3, Taber}, and cardiac tissue \cite{Kroon, Goktepe}. The achievements in cardiovascular system is extraordinary considering the extra challenge of anisotropy. The anisotropic growth under myocardial infarction in vivo is characterized in \cite{Tsamis}, the reorientation of the microstructural directions is studied in \cite{Kuhl4, Kuhl5}. It is even discovered that cardiac muscle grows eccentrically in response to volume overload \cite{Goktepe2}, but concentrically in case of pressure overload \cite{Rausch}.

\subsection{Motivation of the Proposed Research - 0.5 page}
Although the continuum mechanical approach has been more or less established, there are unsolved problems:
the first problem is the lack of realistic boundary conditions on the solid tissues, which often lead to the unrealistic deformations. For instance, the study in \cite{Kuhl3} on patient-specific human aorta yields growth towards the outside rather than the inside after the stent operation because of the non-physiological boundary conditions. Since soft tissues grow in the fluid environment, the fluid-solid interaction (FSI) could act as a natural bound on the tissues. Unfortunately few of the published studies is devoted to account for it due to the complexity of coupling fluid and solid.

Another open issue is the mass flux. In the modeling of the growth, the increased mass either comes from the mass source inside the tissues or the mass flux coming from the outside. In the latter case, mass flux is considered as an additional boundary condition. In reality, the mass flux comes from the fluid environment, which could in turn change the fluid environment and furthermore affect the growth. With the modeling of FSI, we could furthermore consider mass flux in fluid equations in order to obtain a more realistic system.

With the introduction of fluid environment, a new problem emerges, which is the time scale. Biological growth happens at the time scale of weeks, months or even years. To simulate this process, the time step used is usually very large. However, to simulate the effect of the blood flow on the tissue in the vascular environment, the time scale of interest is usually several cardiac cycles, which is at the scale of seconds. Therefore it is important to find a way to coordinate two different time scales so that both processes can be reasonably simulated. Towards this end, we adopt a time-lapse approach based on the theory of ``small on large''.

\section{OBJECTIVE AND EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE - 1.5 page}

\subsection{Objectives}
The objective of this project is to build a comprehensive growth model in the fluid medium with mass exchange. It is accomplished with the following tasks:

\textbf{Task 1:} Fully understand and implement the continuum approach to model tissue growth. Two inputs of tissue growth - mass source and mass flux will be carefully analyzed. The stand-alone solid growth simulation will be performed and validated with simple cases where solutions are known.

\textbf{Task 2:} Couple the solid tissue growth with the fluid environment. The fluid-solid interaction will be verified and validated to make sure large deformation can be accurately predicted. Meanwhile, the growth of solid is expected to be bounded by fluid pressure. The improvements will be examined by comparing to existing simulation results.
 
\textbf{Task 3:} Model the mass transfer from the fluid to the solid. Especially, the mass conservation equation of the fluid will be modified to reflect the mass loss. At this point, fluid flow and solid growth are modeled at the same time scale, with a disturbed initial fluid field. The established mass flux will be quantitively examined.

\textbf{Task 4:} Relax the real-time coupling between the solid and fluid to a time-lapse scheme. In this task, FSI and the growth are computed alternately with different time steps. To solve the FSI with small time step, the growth will be frozen based on the assumption that the growth process is too slow to have a significant effect during a few seconds. Once the FSI computation finishes, an average load of the fluid to the solid tissue could be obtained and used as the external load in the growth simulation, which uses a much larger time step.

\textbf{Task 5:} Perform patient-specific simulation experiments using the numerical framework.

\subsection{Expected Significance}
The successful delivery and outcome of the proposed tasks have significant impact on both engineering and medical fields. On the engineering aspect, a complete growth in fluid medium with mass transfer is expected to be built, which has not been done before. The developed numerical framework does not involve any specific requirement on the governing equations of the growth, therefore any existing growth model can be inserted into it. The proposed ideas of mass exchange, and time-lapse can be adopted in other multiphysical areas. The simulation tools will be thoroughly verified and validated, from simple and idealized cases with known solutions to the patient-specific cases, and constantly maintained and improved, as open source software to the research community.

From a medical science perspective, the outcome of this study will enhance our understanding to various biological processes such as tumor growth, restenosis, bone development and so on. We will be able to explain and predict the growth of tissues under certain mechanical loadings, so that patient-specific recommendations on medical operations including surgical ventricular restoration, stent application, hip replacement, etc., can be made.

As a fundamental feature of life, growth is an extremely complex phenomenon. Multidisciplinary research is the key to this challenging but rewarding research problem. This project will contribute to the understanding and controlling of growth from the view of mechanical engineering, which will at least take us one step closer in healing a huge number of diseases.

\section{RESULTS FROM PRIOR RELATED WORK - 2.5 pages}

\subsection{Framework for Fluid-Structure Interactions}
Our objects of interest such as tumor cells, and blood vessels are immersed in fluid, which makes it more than fitting to adopt the concepts of the immersed finite element method (IFEM). Using a conventional boundary-fitted technique is challenging as they would require prohibitive amount of time for mesh updating and interface tracking. The IFEM, on the contrary, is a non-boundary-fitted approach where the background is represented with fixed Eulerian grid and the objects represented with Lagrangian mesh are freely moving on top of the fixed grid. Proper coupling schemes are also developed to link the independent domains. Since most objects immersed in the microenvironment are solid objects that occupy volumes and have their physical material representations, the IFEM shows tremendous advantage in that regard. Furthermore, the growth of tissue involves large deformation and mass change, which pose extra difficulty to the conventional boundary-fitted technique as the coupling is essentially ``one-way"  from fluid to solid, which tends to diverge after a few steps.

\end{wrapfigure}

Dr. Zhang was the original developer of the immersed finite element method (IFEM) \cite{Zhang}. After thorough verification of 2-D and 3-D fluid-structure interaction problems over the years \cite{Zhang,Zhang2,Zhang3,Zhang4,Zhang5,Zhang6,Zhang7,Zhang8} , it has since been successfully applied to applications in biomedical engineering fields involving highly complex systems \cite{Zhang9,Zhang10,Zhang11,Zhang12,Zhang13,Zhang14,Zhang15,Zhang18}. In \cite{Zhang10}, the real stent deployment in the artery with a realistic stent structure is simulated, and the fluid-structure interaction is carefully analyzed. Fig \ref{fig:IFEM_stent} presents the magnitude and profile of the velocity in the transverse plane during the transient analysis on the deformation of the stent during its deployment \cite{Zhang10}. It demonstrates a uniform velocity distribution in the direction of expansion, illustrating how well the IFEM model simulates the expansion mechanism. Therefore IFEM is expected to be a powerful tool that can be used in growth modeling. 


\subsection{Growth Modeling}
The groundwork of growth modeling has been laid down recently. The key idea of the kinematics of the growth model is the multiplicative decomposition of deformation into an elastic part and a growth part, where an incompatible intermediate configuration is introduced. In the recent work of Dr. Zhang's group, the stand-alone growth of solid tissues is simulated. In this work, the mass increase is achieved through the mass source inside the solid material, which is governed by a given linear function. The growth is assumed to be isotropic thus can be represented by a scalar evaluated at every integration point called growth factor. The governing function is designed such that it is only activated when the hydrostatic pressure exceeds a certain criterion. In addition, the speed of growth decreases with the growth factor to avoid unbounded growth.

As a preliminary result, two sets of numerical experiments are performed. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:growth_results}, the first experiment is the simple uniaxial stretching of soft biomaterial described in \cite{Himpel}. In this case the stretching is enforced steppedly to observe the response of the biomaterial and the recovery of biological equilibrium. It can be observed that the growth factor changes with the mechanical load, with a few steps lagging, which reflects the nature of growth. Interestingly, before the growth factor reaches its maximum, the stress and density increase/decrease sharply each time the mechanical load changes, but then recover to the original state gradually. After the maximum is reached, the equilibrium is broken. This reveals the tissues tend to maintain biological equilibrium under mechanical load by growing. After the growth reaches its limit, the new grown mass will not be able to ``eat up" the stress, therefore the stress will not recover and consequently the density changes.

The other one is the numerical simulation of the stent application in a cylindrical vessel, where the stent is simulated as prescribed displacements of the vessel. As shown in Fig \ref{fig:growth_stent}, the vessel grows gradually after the stent is put into it, maximum growth factor is observed in the area where stent is applied, indicating the restenosis. The simulation result agrees with the clinical experience.
