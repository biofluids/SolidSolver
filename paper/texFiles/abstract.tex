Hyperelastic models are of particular interest in modeling biomaterials. Researchers in biomechanics may not be well-exposed to systematic approaches to implement them with finite element method as they are vaguely addressed in literature. To resolve this, we review the general approach to derive the stress and elasticity tensors for hyperelastic models, and the derivation and implementation of the displacement/pressure mixed formulation. Additionally, we emphasize the treatment of the pressure load as it is commonly encountered and more complicated than explicit traction boundary conditions in biomechanics. These detailed derivations and implementations are validated with numerical experiments. More importantly, a step-by-step framework is built for modeling various types of hyperelastic materials. Following this framework, one could implement any hyperelastic model with the proposed approach.
