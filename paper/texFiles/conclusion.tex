\section{Concluding Remarks}

% As a benchmark, we computed a series of cases for Mooney-Rivlin model under different pressures. The computational deformation and stress are in very good agreement with the theoretical solutions. Then we also demonstrated the effectiveness of our derivations for Yeoh and HGO models based on the benchmark. 

%At last, we briefly introduced the finite element formulation in the updated Lagrange form to be consulted by the readers work in current coordinates.
