\section{Tests}
In this section, we present two sets of test cases to validate the results we obtained with the formulations we derived. The first case is the biaxial tension test which is used to calibrate material constants. For isotropic materials, the analytical solution is easy to find if we assume the material is incompressible. The second case is the expansion of a vessel, which is a very representative application in the field of biomechanics.  

\subsection{Biaxial Tension Test}
\label{biaxial_tension_test}
In this test, we examine $3$ isotropic models followed by $1$ anisotropic model. A long bar loaded equally in two directions with a range of fixed tractions. The section of the bar is a $1$ $m^2$-square. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:biaxial_schematic}, the bottom surface is fixed in the $z$-direction; the left surface is fixed in the $y$-direction and the back surface is fixed in the $x$-direction. External tractions are applied to the front and right surfaces. The stretch $\lambda$ is defined as the ratio between the deformed length to the original length, then for isotropic incompressible material, the stress is expressed as:
\begin{equation}
S_{11} = S_{22} = 2(1 - {\lambda}^{-6})(\frac{\partial\Psi_{iso}}{\partial\bar{I}_1} + {\lambda}^2\frac{\partial\Psi_{iso}}{\partial\bar{I}_2}), \quad S_{33} = 0
\end{equation}
where $S_{11}$, $S_{22}$, $S_{33}$ are the diagonal components of the PK2 stress, all the off-diagonal components are $0$.

Denote the nonzero component of PK2 stress as $S$. For Mooney-Rivlin model, plug in Equation \ref{iso1}, we have

\begin{equation}
S = (1 - {\lambda}^{-6})(\mu_1 + \mu_2{\lambda}^2)
\end{equation}
and therefore the nominal stress $P$ is
\begin{equation}
P = \lambda S =  (\lambda - {\lambda}^{-5})(\mu_1 + \mu_2{\lambda}^2)
\end{equation}
Neglecting the $\mu_2$ terms we have the nominal stresse for Neo-Hookean model
\begin{equation}
P = \lambda S =  \mu_1(\lambda - {\lambda}^{-5})
\end{equation}
Similarly, for Yeoh model
\begin{equation}
P = \lambda S = 2(\lambda - {\lambda}^{-5})[c_1 + 2c_2(2{\lambda}^2 + {\lambda}^{-4} - 3) + 3c_3(2{\lambda}^2 + {\lambda}^{-4} - 3)^2]
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

The material constants used in these models are curve-fitted from the standard ASTM412 tensile test results of the rubber used in the transmission mounts \cite{Sharma}. In Neo-Hookean model, $\mu_1 = 0.6548$ MPa; in Mooney-Rivlin model, $\mu_1 = 0.595522$ MPa, $\mu_2 = 0.050381$ MPa; in Yeoh model, $c_1 = 0.358756$ MPa, $c_2 = - 0.0508009$ MPa, $c_3 = 0.0142132$ MPa. The Poisson's ratios for all the models are over $\nu = 0.49999$, close enough to incompressibility.

Figure \ref{fig:biaxial1} shows the results of the theoretical calculation and numerical computations for all $3$ models for $\lambda$ in the range of $1$ to $1.8$. Perfect agreement is achieved. As expected, in the small strain range, all these models have similar linear performance. Also, it can be seen that $\mu_2$ in Mooney-Rivlin model acts as a modification to $\mu_1$ in Neo-Hookean model which increases the stiffness. In large strain range, the stiffness of Yeoh model grows quickly, becoming significantly larger than the others due to the inclusion of the higher order terms.

To demonstrate the anisotropy of HGO model, we compare the stretches in two directions in the biaxial tension test. We use the material parameters calibrated from the media layer of the artery in \cite{Holzapfel2} but only one direction is strengthened. That is, both two families of fibers are arranged in the same direction while the tractions are still applied in two directions. The material parameters are $\mu_1 = 3$ KPa, $k_1 = 2.3632$ KPa and $k_2 = 0.8393$. We vary the direction of the fibers measured by the angle from the $x$ direction denoted as $\alpha$, from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. 

We define the stretch ratio $\lambda$ in Equation \ref{stretchratio}, and plot the stretch ratio against the nominal stress in Figure \ref{fig:biaxial2}. Just as what we expect, the stretch ratio at $\alpha = 0^\circ$ is the same as $\alpha = 90^\circ$, and similarly for $\alpha = 30^\circ$ and $\alpha = 60^\circ$. 
$\lambda_y$ is greater than $\lambda_x$ when $0^\circ < \alpha < 45^\circ$ since the $x$ direction is strengthened more. As the angle gets larger, $\lambda_x$ becomes greater too. While $\alpha = 45^\circ$ two directions become symmetric again.

\begin{equation}
\label{stretchratio}
\lambda = 
\begin{cases}
	\lambda_y/\lambda_x, & \text{$\alpha = 0^\circ$, $30^\circ$ or $45^\circ$} \\
	\lambda_x/\lambda_y, & \text{$\alpha = 60^\circ$ or $90^\circ$}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cylindrical Pressure Vessel}
\label{pressure_vessel}
We consider a vessel under lumen pressure which is a typical application as the second experiment. The vessel has an internal radius of $R_i = 7$ m and an external radius of $R_o = 18.625$ m. Only a quarter of vessel is considered with plain strain assumption as shown in Figure \ref{fig:vessel_schematic}. $21$ nodes are uniformly distributed in radial direction. The material parameters we used is the same as in Section \ref{biaxial_tension_test} except that in the HGO model, two families of fibers are arranged in the $\theta-z$ plane with constant angles to the circumferential direction of $\pm 50^\circ$. 

As a benchmark, we model the vessel with Mooney-Rivlin model and compare the radial displacement, hoop stress, radial stress, and axial stress with the analytical solutions. The analytical solutions for incompressible material are found in \cite{Green} as follows: 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
p_i &= 2(\mu_1 + \mu_2)(log\frac{{R_i}^2 + b}{{R_o}^2 + b} - 2log\frac{R_i}{R_o} +
b\frac{{R_o}^2 - {R_i}^2}{({R_o}^2+b)({R_i}^2+b)}) \\
u_r &= -R + \sqrt{R^2 + b} \\
p &= - p_i - \mu_2 - (\mu_1 + \mu_2)(log\frac{r}{R_i} + \frac{b}{2}(r^2 - {R_i}^2) - log\frac{R}{R_i} + {(\frac{R_i}{r})}^2) ) \\
\sigma_{\theta} &= p + \mu_2 + (\mu_1 + \mu_2)(\frac{r}{R})^2 + C \\
\sigma_r &= p + \mu_2 + (\mu_1 + \mu_2)(\frac{R}{r})^2 + C \\
\sigma_z &= p +  \mu_1 + \mu_2[(\frac{R}{r})^2 + (\frac{r}{R})^2] + C
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $R$ and $r$ are the radial coordinate before and after deformation, $p$ is the hydrostatic pressure, $u_r$ is the radial displacement, and $\sigma_{\theta}$, $\sigma_r$ and $\sigma_z$ are the hoop, radial and axial stresses respectively. $b$ is a constant determined by the internal pressure $p_i$, and $C$ is an arbitrary constant since the material is incompressible.

Fig \ref{fig:mooney-rivlin1} shows the stress components and the radial displacement along radius direction under the pressure of $p_i = 200$ KPa. Good agreement is achieved on all the components. Notice the axial stress is usually hard to predict but our result is satisfactory. Furthermore, we pick the node at the midpoint in the radial direction ($R = 12.8125$ m) and study its deformation under different internal pressures. As shown in Fig \ref{fig:mooney-rivlin2}, the computational result and analytical solution agree perfectly with each other.

Now that the validity of our computation is confirmed. We then compare the results of Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Yeoh and HGO model. Figure \ref{fig:models} shows the results of these models under an inner pressure of $p_i = 350$ KPa.

%As the last test case we compare HGO model to Neo-Hookean model. The parameters used in the HGO model is still the same as in Section \ref{biaxial_tension_test}, the geometry and mesh are the same as in previous cases. The pressure is $1.5$ KPa. To demonstrate the effect of the anisotropic part of the HGO model, we use the same $\mu_1$ and $\kappa$ in the Neo-Hookean model. This time, the two families of fibers are arranged in the $\theta-z$ plane with constant angles to the circumferential direction of $\pm 50^\circ$. From Figure \ref{fig:nh_hgo} we can see that overall the vessel is significantly strengthened as the radial displacement is much smaller. While the radial stress does not change much (similar to Yeoh model), the hoop stress is smaller but has a similar trend. However the axial stress changes dramatically. In Neo-Hookean model the inner surface has the maximum axial stress while in HGO model the outer surface has the maximum axial stress. But overall both hoop stress and axial stress are much smaller in the HGO model.
