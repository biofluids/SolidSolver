\section{Numerical Experiments}
\label{experiments}
In this section, we present two sets of test cases to validate the derived formulas. The first case is a biaxial tension test which is often used to calibrate material constants. For isotropic materials, the analytical solution can be easily found if the material is assumed to be incompressible. The second case is the expansion of a $2$D cylinder. It is widely used to validate numerical simulations as the theoretical solutions can often be found for simple models.

\subsection{Biaxial Tension Test}
\label{biaxial_tension_test}
In this test, we examine the $3$ isotropic models (Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and Yeoh models) and $1$ anisotropic HGO model. Consider a long bar loaded equally in two directions with fixed tractions. The section of the bar is a $1$ $m^2$-square. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:biaxial_schematic}, the back surface is fixed in the $x$-direction; the left surface is fixed in the $y$-direction and the bottom surface is fixed in the $z$-direction. External tractions are applied to the front and right surfaces. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Schematic diagram of biaxial tension test}
\label{fig:biaxial_schematic}
\end{figure}

The bar is stretched by the tractions in $x$ and $y$ directions, and compressed in the $z$ direction in order to maintain the volume. The stretch $\lambda$ is defined as the ratio between the deformed length to the original length in $x$ and $y$ directions. For an isotropic incompressible material the theoretical solution of the diagonal components of the PK2 stress is expressed as:
\begin{equation} \label{biaxialPK2}
S_{11} = S_{22} = 2(1 - {\lambda}^{-6})\left(\frac{\partial\Psi_\mathrm{iso}}{\partial\bar{I}_1} + {\lambda}^2\frac{\partial\Psi_\mathrm{iso}}{\partial\bar{I}_2}\right), \quad S_{33} = 0
\end{equation}
All the off-diagonal components are $0$.

Since the nonzero components of the PK2 stress are the same, we denote them as $S$. For Mooney-Rivlin model, plug Equation \ref{iso1} into \ref{biaxialPK2}, we have:

\begin{equation}
S = (1 - {\lambda}^{-6})(\mu_1 + \mu_2{\lambda}^2)
\end{equation}
Therefore, the nominal stress $P$ is:
\begin{equation}
P = \lambda S =  (\lambda - {\lambda}^{-5})(\mu_1 + \mu_2{\lambda}^2)
\end{equation}
When $\mu_2 = 0$ terms we have the nominal stress for Neo-Hookean model:
\begin{equation}
P = \lambda S =  \mu_1(\lambda - {\lambda}^{-5})
\end{equation}
Similarly, for Yeoh model:
\begin{equation}
P = \lambda S = 2(\lambda - {\lambda}^{-5})\left[c_1 + 2c_2(2{\lambda}^2 + {\lambda}^{-4} - 3) + 3c_3(2{\lambda}^2 + {\lambda}^{-4} - 3)^2\right]
\end{equation}



Table \ref{parameters} lists the material constants used in the isotropic models, which are curve-fitted from the standard ASTM412 tensile test results of the rubber used in the transmission mounts \cite{Sharma}. The Poisson's ratios for all the models are set to $\nu = 0.49999$, close enough to incompressibility. Note that the greatest Poisson's ratio that the displacement-based formulation can handle is case-dependent. But to avoid locking and the difficulty to solve the linear matrix equation, in some commercial softwares, such as Abaqus, the mixed formulation must be used when the Poisson's ratio is greater than $0.48$ based on the author's tested cases.

Figure \ref{fig:biaxial1} shows the results of the theoretical calculations and numerical computations for all $3$ isotropic models for $\lambda$ in the range of $1$ to $1.8$. Since the traction is fixed in the original configuration, the nominal stress equals the traction. Perfect agreement is achieved at every discrete data point. As expected, in the small strain range, all these models have similar linear performance. It can be seen that $\mu_2$ in Mooney-Rivlin model acts as a modification to $\mu_1$ in Neo-Hookean model which increases the stiffness. In large strain range, the stiffness of Yeoh model grows quickly, becoming significantly larger than the others due to the inclusion of the higher order terms.

\end{figure}


To demonstrate the anisotropy of HGO model, we compare the stretches in two directions in the biaxial tension test. We use the material parameters calibrated from the media layer of the artery in \cite{Holzapfel2} but only one direction is strengthened. That is, both two families of fibers are arranged in the same direction while the tractions are still applied in two directions. The material parameters are $\mu_1 = 3$ KPa, $k_1 = 2.3632$ KPa, $k_2 = 0.8393$ and $\kappa = 1 \times 10^5$ KPa. We vary the direction of the fibers measured by the angle from the $x$ direction denoted as $\alpha$, from $0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$ to observe the trends qualitatively as there is no existing theoretical solution. 

The stretch ratio $\lambda$ is defined as $\lambda = 
\begin{cases}
	\lambda_y/\lambda_x, & \text{$\alpha = 0^\circ$, $30^\circ$ or $45^\circ$} \\
	\lambda_x/\lambda_y, & \text{$\alpha = 60^\circ$ or $90^\circ$}
\end{cases}
$
where $\lambda_y$ is greater than $\lambda_x$ when $0^\circ < \alpha < 45^\circ$ since the $x$ direction is strengthened more. As the angle gets larger, $\lambda_x$ becomes greater too. Figure \ref{fig:biaxial2} shows the nominal stress, which is nothing but the traction applied to each surface, as a function of the stretch ratio. As expected, the stretch ratio at $\alpha = 0^\circ$ is the same as $\alpha = 90^\circ$. These complementary angles of $\alpha$ yields the most asymmetric results since the stretch ratio is the largest for a given nominal stress. Same stretch ratios are obtained for $\alpha = 30^\circ$ and $\alpha = 60^\circ$. 
When $\alpha = 45^\circ$ two directions become symmetric and the stretch ratio remains to be $1$.
 

\subsection{Cylindrical Pressure Vessel with Isotropic Models}
\label{pressure_vessel}
In the second test, we consider a vessel under internal pressure. This case is more challenging than the previous one, especially in the Cartesian coordinates system since the deformation varies both in the radial and the circumferential directions. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:vessel_schematic}, the cylinder has an internal radius of $R_i = 7$ m and an external radius of $R_o = 18.625$ m. Only a quarter of vessel is considered with plain strain assumption. Symmetry conditions are applied to the two sides to simulate a complete cylinder. The material parameters for the isotropic models are the same as the previous example, listed in Table \ref{parameters}. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{./figures/vessel_schematic.jpg}
	\caption{Cross section of the vessel}
	\label{fig:vessel_schematic}
\end{figure}

As a benchmark, we model the vessel with Mooney-Rivlin model and compare the radial displacement, hoop stress, radial stress, and axial stress with the analytical solutions. For incompressible materials, the analytical solutions are found in \cite{Green} as follows: 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
u_r &= -R + \sqrt{R^2 + b} \\
p &= - p_i - \mu_2 - (\mu_1 + \mu_2)\left(\log \frac{r}{R_i} + \frac{b}{2}(r^2 - {R_i}^2) - \log \frac{R}{R_i} + {\left(\frac{R_i}{r}\right)}^2 \right) \\
\sigma_{\theta\theta} &= p + \mu_2 + (\mu_1 + \mu_2)\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^2 + C \\
\sigma_{rr} &= p + \mu_2 + (\mu_1 + \mu_2)\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^2 + C \\
\sigma_{zz} &= p +  \mu_1 + \mu_2\left[\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^2\right] + C
\end{align}
where $R$ and $r$ are the radial coordinate before and after deformation, $p$ is the hydrostatic pressure, $u_r$ is the radial displacement, and $\sigma_{\theta\theta}$, $\sigma_{rr}$ and $\sigma_{zz}$ are the hoop, radial and axial stresses, respectively. $C$ is an arbitrary constant to be determined by the reference pressure since the material is incompressible. $b$ is a constant determined by the internal pressure $p_i$ as:
\begin{align}
p_i &= 2(\mu_1 + \mu_2)\left(\log \frac{{R_i}^2 + b}{{R_o}^2 + b} - 2\log \frac{R_i}{R_o} +
b\frac{{R_o}^2 - {R_i}^2}{({R_o}^2+b)({R_i}^2+b)}\right)
\end{align}
\end{subequations} 

Figure \ref{fig:mooney-rivlin1} shows the stress components and the radial displacement along the radial direction under a given internal pressure of $p_i = 200$ KPa. Good agreement is achieved on all the components. There are $21$ nodes that are uniformly distributed in the radial direction. As expected, point on the outer surface undergoes less radial displacement than the inner surface in order to keep the area of cross-section unchanged. All the components of the Cauchy stress exhibit nonuniform distribution. The absolute value of hoop stress and radial stress on the inner surface are more significant than the outer surface. This is not altered by the value of the material constants or the pressure. But by setting different material constants along the radial direction one can obtain more uniform stress distributions \cite{Batra}. Note that the axial stress is usually challenging to validate as they are seldomly shown in literature. The responses of a range of internal pressures are also studied. We pick the node at the midpoint in the radial direction ($R = 12.8125$ m) and study its deformation under different internal pressures from $50$ to $350$ KPa. As shown in Fig \ref{fig:mooney-rivlin2}, the computational result and analytical solution agree perfectly with each other. The variation of the radial displacement and the stress are nonlinear in the sense that the absolute value increases faster at greater pressure. This is similar to what we observed in Figure \ref{fig:biaxial1}.

With the validated implementation of the Mooney-Rivlin model, we then compare the performance of Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and Yeoh model. Figure \ref{fig:models} shows the results of these models under an inner pressure of $p_i = 350$ KPa. All these isotropic models have similar trends, and the discrepancies among different models decrease from the inner surface to the outer surface. It implies that under a moderate pressure, different isotropic models do not make too much difference. The performance of the Yeoh model is very close to the Neo-Hookean model and stiffening effect does not occur. This is because they both have only one invariant and the strain is not large enough for Yeoh model to demonstrate its particular characteristics due to the higher order term. Considering in this case the maximum strain is already significant, and the expansion of vessels is not likely to exceed this maximum, it is expected that Yeoh model and Neo-Hookean model behave similarly.
