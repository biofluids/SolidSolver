\section{OBJECTIVE AND EXPECTED SIGNIFICANCE: 1 page-Zhang}

\subsection{Objectives}
The objective of this project is to \textbf{design and implement a toolkit that can efficiently coupling existing solvers for multiphysics and multiscale analysis}. This proposed work is accomplished by completing the following tasks:

\textbf{Task 1: Designing Coupling Algorithm} 

\textbf{Task 2: CPU \& GPU} 

\textbf{Task 3: Building Front and Back Ends with Existing Open Source Tools - w/ Kitware} 

\textbf{Task 4: Open Source Project: Expand and Build Sustainable User Base}

\textbf{Task 5: Outreach}

\section{RESULTS FROM PRIOR NSF SUPPORTS- 0.5 pages - Zhang, Li, Carothers}

Dr. Zhang, as a co-PI, recently completed a NSF grant, ACI-1126125, entitled ``MRI: Acquisition of a Balanced Environment for Simulation'', 9/1/2011-8/31/2015 (PI: Christopher Carothers), with a total funded amount of \$2,657,633. 
The goal for this MRI (major research instrument) award was the construction of the compute core of the cyberinstrument Blue Gene/Q. 
%
\textbf{Intellectual Merit}: This project supported building a powerful MRI cyberinstrument combining IBM's new Blue Gene/Q system with integrated large-scale high-performance storage and visualization components 
that provided 
a balanced computation and data storage cyberinstrument for massively parallel simulations and data analytics. 
%
%a well-balanced massively parallel computing platform that is uniquely capable of supporting cutting edge research across a wide range of disciplines from semantic integration of the abundance of heterogeneous, multimodal, and multiscale data to improve personal health to modeling flow and disease in the arterial system. 
%
\textbf{Broader Impacts}: This cyberinstrument provided a new major research capability that is now accessible to a diverse set of disciplinary and inter-disciplinary researchers, students and industry collaborators. The instrument's combination of scale, balance, and Internet accessibility made it particularly valuable for under-served researchers, such as those from states and minority-serving institutions who would not otherwise have access to such a powerful resource.
%, nor the ability to pre- and post-process the massive data sets involved.
%
%Since this is a MRI grant, no salary or student support was requested. 
Fifteen (15)  articles were published from Dr. Zhang using the equipment built with the grant \cite{li-particletransport-2015,cwang2013,wang-zhang-mifem,zhang2013,zhang2014,chuwang2015,wang2012semi,wang2013modified,zhang2013advancements,yong-2013-jcp,yong2013,yong-slip2013,chuwang2014,zhang2014modeling,yang2016VFdraft}, while 1 is under review \cite{yang2016PMLdraft}. Research product from this grant also includes established open-source software tools to study biomedical applications involving fluid-structure interactions, currently published and maintained on GitHub.
